ROADMAP

BIGGEST ISSUE - when continuing game, doesn't read from existing savefile and writes stats etc., twice!.



* For check_stats()
* check_skills()
* check_items()

They should not read from the objects, they should read from SAVEFILE.
if (savefile.object("magian_save.txt" ,ios::in)
{
  savefile.object.exsts
  {
    read xx from there
  }
}
 exists then (read from there)
 else
 {
  read from pointer object
 }


1.5
Setup function ALSO in continuegame() writes inventory to file twice, but an if exists then dont clause.
for potion and leather boots.
