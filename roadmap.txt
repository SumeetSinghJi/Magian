ROADMAP

* shoot not working
* item store not working for second item - consider algorithm
* build save()
* logic() - level 1 win = save()
* l2gamestart - add load_player()
* collission_logic() not stopping player
* enemy_collission() not working to reduce lives
* add collission for obstacle
* change lives to vitality
* lives need to print to savefile and loaded on newgame() or continue()


consider breaking up logic() to
* logic()
*   win_logic()
*   collision_logic()
*   item_pickup_logic()
*   levelup_logic()
*   enemy_movement_logic() - consider algorith

savefile_object.open("magian_save.txt", ios::in);
if(savefile_object.is_open())
{
  cout << "skills";
}
savefile.object.close()
else {}
