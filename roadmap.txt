Roadmap

0. - Levels
Their must be a custom setup() for each level
This will populate enemies, items, money, custom width/map, etc.,
e.g. setup1(), setup2(), for draw_level_1, and 2, and so on.

0.1 - ASCII Sprites
If possible that an enemy in the vector can have a custom symbol in the draw logic part.
As part of above, since draw levels are unique, then different enemies can be possible drawn in from setup()?
