global in settings if music is turned off then 
VARIABLE MUSIC_VARIABLE = PlaySoundW(NULL, NULL, 0);

1
Achievements - 
* new string achievements_variable
* achievements reached in logic() update achievements_variable and save to file
* new case menu for reading achievements
* List of achievements in readme

2
Unlockables
* read achievements_variable from save
* achievements = new skills_variables e.g. Fireball
* create fireball()
* View unlockables, new items, characters, under achievements case menu option 

3. Skills
* Skills assigned numbers e.g. numbers 1 = shoot(), 2 = fireball()
* change skills with check skills() which changes input SPACE_BAR to new skill selected
on Windows and Unix like OS
* update check_skills with achievements (check last roadmap)
* Specific scroll item drop with rand() drawn to buffer
* scroll item adds new skill

3
Their must be a custom setup() for each level
This will populate enemies, items, money, custom width/map, etc.,
e.g. setup1(), setup2(), for draw_level_1, and 2, and so on.

4
If possible that an enemy in the vector can have a custom symbol in the draw logic part.
As part of above, since draw levels are unique, then different enemies can be possible drawn in from setup()?

5
start of draw()
1. dump inventory into savefile
Getting new item in draw()
2. getting new item = new trigger write to save file.
