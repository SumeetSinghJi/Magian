Their must be a custom setup() for each level
This will populate enemies, items, money, custom width/map, etc.,
e.g. setup1(), setup2(), for draw_level_1, and 2, and so on.

If possible that an enemy in the vector can have a custom symbol in the draw logic part.
As part of above, since draw levels are unique, then different enemies can be possible drawn in from setup()?

Getting new item in draw()
