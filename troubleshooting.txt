Troubleshooting

1. The playsoundW() function only works as the argument "-lwinmm" is passed to tasks.json for VScode to build app
for full release consider CMake.

Known bugs

1. Fatal flaw in code - When selecting a new level e.g. Level 2, how does the game know to input(), logic()?
it has something to do with while (!gameover) {...}. how can I fix this professionally.

2. Cannot set locale, therefore cannot cin <<, then cout >> unicode e.g. Jap, Chinese, in settings()

3. clear_screen(); in draw_level_1(); is too slow. used hard coded system("cls") faster for buffering
