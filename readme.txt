                                            STORY

_________________________________________________________________________________________________   



During ~1300 BCE (~year 3300 of Shahenshai) in Arianna (present day Afghanistan) before the rise
of reformed Zoroastrian belief of the earlier Aryan divine pantheon of gods, goddess, and
everything in between lies Agni the origin school of learning magic, the art of mages to harness
and control supernatural powers.

The school’s history begun with yoga but eventually adopted the sciences of literacy, diplomacy,
leadership, and eventually graduation of students to magus (magicians) to bring further knowledge
back to their homes.

Students would come from around the world from Shang (China), Mycenae (Greece), Babylon (Iraq)
and beyond to study and learn magic.

On a fateful day, a student of unknown heritage gained accepted into the Agni school of arts.
He spoke little but
was a polyglot protégé. His language and culture were heavily scrutinised as the syllables the
young adult spoke was of nothing related to recorded language.

Reciting the language led to the formation of heat among the lips of speakers, enough to warm cold
water drunk from a pitcher. The language spread like wildfire to the faculty and the study of the
foreign language came to be known as Magic.

The rudimentary magic through experimentation grew to encompass new heights under faculty staff
with practitioners now able to conjure fire in their hands, learn to throw it, and even in 
disastrous scenarios still spoken today inflamed themselves to death.

A ban eventually was enacted into place for studying magic. The Shah forced practitioners
(King) to stay in the school. Eventually a routine formed to control magic which required the
art of literacy to understand past magic use, experimentation to evaluate and record the present
and rigorous yoga to prime their bodies to control their future.

Use of magic exhausted practitioners and fire eventually became seen as a source of worship within
the kingdom. Practitioners were eventually allowed out of the academy and became esteemed advisors to
Shahs and officials.

On an ill omen day on winter solstice when freezing air fought hard against the breaths of magicians
and farmers alike. Rain doused conjured fires and torrential downpour built up within the
school compound. Previous scrolls, belongings and woodwork drenched and at ruins. 
The school threatened by flood and collapse had refugees fleeing the chaos. Locked magicians,
attendants, and visitors were
crushed from falling book stacks and furniture, drowned and at worst cases trampled by escapees.

A faculty mage decided to conjure a conflagration so strong that winter would eventually cease. The
mage named Ahriman in good intention gathered his belongings, precious magic recital scrolls, and
searched to find a source to channel his magic. Seeing his folk crushed by the relentless flooding
he chooses to cast the forbidden spell. Self-conflagration. He chooses his body as a medium of fire
and with all the training of decades recited the words "Agni humara sariram".

Ahriman’s body heated. The intensity of his recital led to causing his inflammable body to heat at a
molecular level. The very nature of his body’s atoms split at violent intervals defying laws of
science as known. The mage started to burn from the inside. The source of fire in his body grew
in intensity to match the external forces of the waves that started to surround him. The very nature
of duality of rain and flame, winter and summer, heat and cold raged in and out of his body.

With tears in his eyes that could be confused as the steam that was generating around him Ahriman died
inside yet the flame continued to use his body as a medium. The floods did not stop that night and
recounters of the tale elsewhere remembered it as a worldwide phenomenon. The steam clouds surrounding
Ahriman tore the very fabric and nature of space.

Yama the god of deaths realm opened inside Ahriman’s body. The cosmic flood of atman (souls of the
dead) and chaos flowed from outside the magician’s body. Unfathomable horror crawled from Ahriman’s chest
with a silent howling of dark fog. Ahriman’s body ripped to shreds and in its place the tear of the
cosmic fabric called nirvana.

In an historical event observed only from the eyes of the onlookers not yet killed in the ensuring
floods of torrential downpour and chaos of souls stemming from Ahriman’s once place, now exists a hole.
the gate of evil was thus opened on Earth. The cosmic river nirvana of atman (souls) balance caused
the very nature of life on Earth to change forever. Rishis (recluse pious men) and Magus (Magicians)
were torn apart with the ensuring chaos, the former blaming the latter of releasing evil.

The Ahriman’s soul rupture marked a new era. Rampant magic fire, 
rakshasa (supernatural malicious extradimensional monsters), funeral rites change dramatically
with new divine powers worshipped to save commonfolk from the new terrors at night, witch
hunts against magic practitioners, invading kingdoms hoping to take advantage of the weak Arianna
state in magical turmoil led to groups of surviving Magus to band together and create
a new school of Agni. Nava Agni.

The school curriculum eventually grew to encompass the study of the new world’s phenomena. Courses
such as rakshasa studies, extradimensional research, geology, and even martial arts to understand
and combat the newfound threats. During this time other parts of the world also faced their own 
threats, and witch hunts, and subsequent debauchery. The nation of Arianna was no more limited
to its own minding but now was a centre of worldly affair, where the curios, diplomats, travellers,
scholars, those who wanted to vanquish evil to bring honour to themselves and humanity travelled to
Arianna to experience the carnal evil.

The more concerning matters of those that considered themselves civilised, were the newfound 
sycophants, followers of the rakshasa who saw their entrance into this world as a sign of them
new god. Atheists, agnostics, and sceptics now genuinely believed in the supernatural. Science was
thrown aside for religious belief. Many rakshasa sycophants could be seen babbling to the beasts
in languages not recorded elsewhere. These people came to be known as mleechas and their heresy to
civilised folk was cause for their deaths by government laws.

There were yet others who made life of traversing the rakshasa infested plains, neither good
nor evil. Many individuals hunted, or pillaged remains of rakshasa to use their bodies often
made of strange material such
as multicoloured talons and hooves, or scaly magically infused hides for exotic leathers. New 
industries invented due to existence of rakshasas.

The Rakshasa themself was the topic of conversation among Earths inhabitants. Rakshasas being
otherworldly beings (at least invisible to the presence before their existence) were a varied lot.
Their numbers were tracked by state officials’ appointees, or landowners to try to determine
the threat they posed and their countermeasures if plausible. No one could accurately survey them
numbers since they did not breed as far as anyone recorded so far and were born
from an extra dimensional plane invading Earth through the hole that sprung up from Ahriman’s
hole.

The rakshasa varied in size, stature, colour, temperament, personality, strength, magic and countless
attributes. They were atypical. A specimen could be as short as a mouse or as tall as ten humans
standing on top of each other. Some could have two feet, others a slithering body, and others with wings.

Some specimens of rakshasa were short enough to be killed by an average human male would ignore
its own weak stature and
charge at humans with a rage so intense it would run into a spear and disembowel itself.
Although the rakshasa varied in appearance, and personality there were however uniform types of
them that could be categorised. In example flying rakshasa had the appearance of common gar alligators
yet with wings, and a defensive personality.

Their personalities and temperament meant that most considered malicious to humans, however
their malevolence varied. Often a giant like rakshasa that could rampage across a city and kill
thousands would be content scaring children and revel in its own trickery. though there was a
difference in attitudes the rakshasa remained widely regarded by humans as malicious due to
their detrimental nature. Rakshasa had no set gender. Some Rakshasa were hermaphrodites.

The rakshasa themselves curiously enough would often at times imitate humans. Many would follow
ideals such as honour, and integrity. Lawfully allowing a woman to cross their path unharmed, yet
following her home and eating her newborns. Some would even go a further step ahead by choosing
to sit back and watch humans exist and challenge the strongest humans to a duel of death. On being
defeated such honourable rakshasa who lost at duelling would submit to defeat and death.

The rakshasa used magic akin to the magus conjuration, however their powers ranged in varied
frequencies. The elements of water, thunder, and earth with the caveat they were unable to summon fire.
All other elements conjured by the rakshasa in various
machinations to cause violence and trickery. Some rakshasas could conjure Earth to rise while a cart
would go by causing it to spill its contents. Some rakshasas could appear out of nowhere from
thunderstorms causing the storms to further aggravate and splitting the Earth with its immense power.

Fire despite the cataclysmic effect it had on Earth remained the single element the rakshasa could
not control, feared and despised. Nirvana the sea of lifeforce was what encompassed the universe,
and the understanding of it was born from fire. Rakshasa traditionally recorded existed as part of Nirvana.
However, it was during Ahriman’s cataclysm, that the fabric between Atman (those remaining as good souls)
and rakshasa those of evil souls split. Rakshasa thus splits from fire. Fire became worshipped 
across the globe as a benevolent spirit known as Agni.

The guise of many rakshasas would earn them admires and worshippers. Shapeshifting was an ability
that some rakshasa employed to take the form of innocent maidens, and satisfy the intimate desires
of humans. Some would use their power to become the vizier to chiefs whispering false stories
to turn their masters against others.

Of these Rakasha and the ones that were too powerful to vanquish, there was no set leadership
amongst them. They were considered simpleminded beasts, unable to control their desires. There were to 
note those of esteemed quality, able to control their temperament causing them to rise to
great infamy.

Thus begins the story of evil on Earth how the old Aryan pantheon was torn asunder by the
cataclysmic event known as the birth of duality, and the magician who spoke of this revelation.

During a reconnaissance of collecting herbs for the Nava (new) Agni school’s faculty staff a prospecting
Magus on their way back to Nava (New) Agni sees a plume in the horizon of dark clouds. On closer
approach the smell of burning wood caused the hurried student to run back to the school in haste...
