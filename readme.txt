                                            STORY

_________________________________________________________________________________________________   



During ~600 BCE (2600 of calendar Shahenshai) in Arianna (present day Afghanistan) before the rise
of reformed Zoroastrian belief of the earlier Aryan divine pantheon of gods, goddess, and
everything in between lies Agni the origin school of learning magic, the art of mages to harness
and control supernatural powers.

The school’s history begun with yoga but eventually adopted the sciences of literacy, diplomacy,
leadership, and eventually graduation of students to magus (magicians) to bring further knowledge
back to their homes.

Students would come from around the world from Shang (China), Mycenae (Greece), Babylon (Iraq)
and beyond to study and learn magic.

On a fateful day, a student was accepted of ivory skin, and almond eyes. He spoke little but
was a polyglot protégé. His language and culture were heavily scrutinised as the syllables the
young adult spoke was of nothing related to recorded language.

Reciting the language led to the formation of heat among the lips of speakers, enough to warm cold
water drunk from a pitcher. The language spread like wildfire to the faculty and the study of the
foreign language came to be known as Magic.

The rudimentary magic through experimentation grew to encompass new heights under faculty staff
with practitioners now able to conjure fire in their hands, learn to throw it, and even in 
disastrous scenarios still spoken today inflamed themselves to death.

A ban eventually was put into place for studying magic and practitioners were forced by the Shah
(king) to stay in the school. Eventually a routine formed to control magic which required the
art of literacy to understand past magic use, experimentation to evaluate and record the present
and rigorous yoga to prime their bodies to control their future.

Use of magic exhausted practitioners and fire eventually became seen as a source of worship within
the kingdom. Practitioners were allowed out and became esteemed advisors to Shahs (Emperors) and
officials.

On an ill omen day on winter solstice when freezing air fought hard against the breaths of students
and farmers alike, with rain dousing conjured fires, heavy torrential started to build up within the
school and scrolls were drenched and at ruins. The school was threatened to flood and locked
magicians, attendants, and visitors were crushed from falling book stacks and arousing drowning from
their sleeps.

A faculty mage decided to case a conflagration so strong that winter would eventually cease. The
mage named Ahriman in good intention gathered his belongings, precious magic recital scrolls, and
searched to find a source to channel his magic. Seeing his folk crushed by the relentless flooding
he chooses to cast the forbidden spell. Self-conflagration. He chooses his body as a medium of fire
and with all the training of decades recited the words "Agni humara sariram".

Ahriman’s body heated. The intensity of his recital led to causing his inflammable body to heat at a
molecular level. The very nature of his body’s atoms split at violent intervals defying laws of
science as known. The mage started to burn from the inside. The source of fire in his body grew
in intensity to match the external forces of the waves that started to surround him. The very nature
of duality of rain and flame, winter and summer, heat and cold raged in and out of his body.

With tears in his eyes that could be confused as the steam that was generating around him Ahriman died
inside yet the flame continued to use his body as a medium. The floods did not stop that night and
recounters of the tale elsewhere remembered it as a worldwide phenomenon. The steam clouds surrounding
Ahriman tore the very fabric and nature of space.

Yama the god of deaths realm opened inside Ahriman’s body. The cosmic flood of atman (souls of the
dead) and chaos flowed from outside the magician’s body. Unfathomable horror crawled from Ahriman’s chest
with a silent howling of dark fog. Ahriman’s body ripped to shreds and in its place the tear of the
cosmic fabric called nirvana.

In an historical event that was seen only from the eyes of the onlookers not yet killed in the ensuring
floods of torrential downpour and chaos of souls stemming from Ahriman’s once place, now present hole
the gate of evil was thus opened on Earth. From this hole that was torn from flesh evil was born on
Earth.

During a reconnaissance of collecting herbs for the leadership a student on his way back to Agni sees
a plume in the horizon of dark clouds. On closer approach the smell of burning wood caused the hurried
student to run back to the school in haste... 

Thus begins the story of evil on Earth how the old Aryan pantheon was forever wiped asunder by the
cataclysmic event known as the birth of duality, and the magician who spoke of this revelation.

Player
* represented by character 'P'
* To move use the keyboard buttons to walk 'W' = UP,'S' = Down,'A' = Left,'D' = RIGHT
* Has 3 lives, but can set less in settings(), difficulty switch
* Moves with keyboard input in logic()

Enemies
* represented by characters such as 'E'
* enemies_vector is a vector of pointer enemy objects initialised through pushback of
pointer enemy objects
in setup()
* Are pointer objects in an enemies vector
* have a speed they move on the x,y plane
* are spawned in draw()
* logic() dictates speed, damage

Game world
* represented by draw()
* Surrounded by character '#' walls that hurt player causing lives--;
* in draw() spawns (P), money ($), enemy (E)
* Every level has unique objectives required to win to progress to next level
* levels get increasingly difficult with harder enemies but better items, money and Skill
opportunities to compensate.

Money

* score == money;
* used in win conditions or to buy more items and train skills at trainers

Win logic
* follow the objectives in your log book by pressing "l" key by default.

Save Load
* header save_game.h called in source code magian.cpp main menu case
to create save game file magian_save.txt 

Level select
* level select variable updated after every win and written to magian_save.txt file
* level select option reads level_select_variable from file above

Inventory
* Inventory is a vector of pointer item objects initialised through pushback of item subclasses
in setup()
* item classes have subclasses of items e.g. potion_subclass
* check_inventory keyboard input "i" gives option to loop through vector of inventory 
and use subclass function use to use that subclasses effect e.g., potion_subclass increases lives++
* inventory vector index item is then removed through vector.erase()
