                                            Game loop logic
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

Main logic of game follows running c++ functions in sequence

void menu() 
1.0. startgame()
1.1. setup()
1.2. gameover = false; // reset the gameover flag to false
1.3. while (!gameover)
1.4. draw_level_1()
1.5. input()
1.6. logic()
1.7. Sleep(150)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

                                            Logic
_________________________________________________________________________________________________


Player
* represented by character 'P'
* To move use the keyboard buttons to walk 'W' = UP,'S' = Down,'A' = Left,'D' = RIGHT
* Has 3 lives, but can set less in settings(), difficulty switch
* Moves with keyboard input in logic()


Enemies
* represented by character 'E'
* are c++ classes
* have a speed they move on the x,y plane
* moves through rand() in logic()
* are spawned in draw()
    //draw enemy
        else if (x == enemy_object.first_enemy_x_pos && y == enemy_object.first_enemy_y_pos) {
            buffer[y][x] = 'E';
        }   
* in logic() dictate damage dealth as
    --lives;

Game world
* represented by draw()
* Surrounded by character '#' walls that hurt player causing lives--;
* in draw() spawns (P), money ($), enemy (E)

Money
* represented by character '$'
* score == money;
* used in win condition to finish level and game

Win logic
* collect enough money ($) to win

Save Load
* header magian_save_game.h called in source code magian.cpp main menu case
to create save game file magian_save.txt 

Level select
* level select variable updated after every win and written to magian_save.txt file
* level select option reads level_select_variable from file above

Inventory
* Inventory is a vector of item classes initialised through pushback of item subclasses
* item classes have subclasses of items e.g. potion_subclass
* check_inventory keyboard input "i" gives option to loop through vector of inventory 
and use subclass function use to use that subclasses effect e.g. potion_subclass increases lives++
* inventory vector index item is then removed through vector.erase()
