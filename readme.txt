                                            STORY

_________________________________________________________________________________________________   



During ~1300 BCE (~year 3300 of Shahenshai) in Arianna (present day Afghanistan) before the rise
of reformed Zoroastrian belief of the earlier Aryan divine pantheon of gods, goddess, and
everything in between lies Agni the origin school of learning magic, the art of mages to harness
and control supernatural powers.

Arianna since antiquity been and warring state. A nation perpetually being invaded and invading. 
New warfare technology from surrounding and domestic origins meant the nation's ruler Shah (King) Pitaji
(Father) was always planning measures to protect and fight against his contemporaries. 
 
To the East of Arianna lies the nation of Aryavarta (home of the Aryans) and to the west lies
the nation Iran (land of the Aryans) similarly named as Arianna to denote the dependent
sister states all successors to the name of the great mythical origin aryan homeland. 
 
To the south lies the great sea. No one yet had crossed completely as tales of dangerous
beasts capsizing beasts and maidens singing songs at darkest of nights luri g sailors to leap
from their boats to drown at their demise chasing the maidens sweet voice. Traders known
as Babylonians and the Indus people had trade routes closer to shores yet erred on
caution on travelling deeper into the ocean. 
 
To the north was the barren wastelands that the ancestors of Aryans arrived from. The cold
harsh climate was unsuitable for agriculture and fire causing their ancestors to migrate
to warmer Plains south. 
 
Shah Pitaji was married when he was 16 to an onlooker in his Zoorkaneh. The sport
represented the prowess of Aryan martial arts were practitioners would wield weapons such
as wooden and metal practice clubs, bows a d shields to use in exercise to practice
battle. Pitajj met his wife Sharmila who was also if similar age watching him practice
his ritual. 
 
Pitaji and Sharmila ruled as king and queen of Arianna their rule stretching the furthest
bounds of previous leaders with an army of loyal soldiers trained themselves in
zoorkhaneh ready to deploy in force to any part of the kingdom in defence if their Shah.
The divine pantheon of the Shah were the Aryan gods. They were a genderless pantheon
of supposed extradimensional beings that created the universe. Others proclaim they
were existing Aryan chiefs of olden times whom their names have become legend
through their heroic actions. 

The school’s history begun with a curriculum of yoga and maths
eventually adopted the sciences of literacy, diplomacy,
leadership, and eventually graduation of students to magus (magicians) to bring further knowledge
back to their homes.

Students would come from around the world from Shang (China), Mycenae (Greece), Babylon (Iraq).
Misr (Egypt) and beyond to study and learn magic.

Although arts have always been studied in Arianna, it wasn't until Vyasa codified the many oral
texts of Aryans into the Rig Veda (an oral poem of great length narrarating the history of
Aryans before being transmitted to script).and other contempoary works. His disciplies worked tirelessly
translating texts from Misr from Papyrus to strong paper scrolls developed in the Shang
Kingdom. An market for scrolls and knowledge sprang up and various schools came into existence to
teach, facilitate and regulate this trade.

On a fateful day, a student of unknown heritage gained accepted into the Agni school of arts.
He spoke little but
was a polyglot protégé. His language and culture were heavily scrutinised as the syllables the
young adult spoke was of nothing related to recorded language.

Reciting the language led to the formation of heat among the lips of speakers, enough to warm cold
water drunk from a pitcher. The language spread like wildfire to the faculty and the study of the
foreign language came to be known as Magic.

The rudimentary magic through experimentation grew to encompass new heights under faculty staff
with practitioners now able to conjure fire in their hands, learn to throw it, and even in 
disastrous scenarios still spoken today inflamed themselves to death.

A ban eventually was enacted into place for studying magic. The Shah forced practitioners
(King) to stay in the school. Eventually a routine formed to control magic which required the
art of literacy to understand past magic use, experimentation to evaluate and record the present
and rigorous yoga to prime their bodies to control their future.

Use of magic exhausted practitioners and fire eventually became seen as a source of worship within
the kingdom. Practitioners were eventually allowed out of the academy and became esteemed advisors to
Shahs and officials.

On an ill omen day on winter solstice when freezing air fought hard against the breaths of magicians
and farmers alike. Rain doused conjured fires and torrential downpour built up within the
school compound. Previous scrolls, belongings and woodwork drenched and at ruins. 
The school threatened by flood and collapse had refugees fleeing the chaos. Locked magicians,
attendants, and visitors were
crushed from falling book stacks and furniture, drowned and at worst cases trampled by escapees.

A faculty mage decided to conjure a conflagration so strong that winter would eventually cease. The
mage named Ahriman in good intention gathered his belongings, precious magic recital scrolls, and
searched to find a source to channel his magic. Seeing his folk crushed by the relentless flooding
he chooses to cast the forbidden spell. Self-conflagration. He chooses his body as a medium of fire
and with all the training of decades recited the words "Agni humara sariram".

Ahriman’s body heated. The intensity of his recital led to causing his inflammable body to heat at a
molecular level. The very nature of his body’s atoms split at violent intervals defying laws of
science as known. The mage started to burn from the inside. The source of fire in his body grew
in intensity to match the external forces of the waves that started to surround him. The very nature
of duality of rain and flame, winter and summer, heat and cold raged in and out of his body.

With tears in his eyes that could be confused as the steam that was generating around him Ahriman died
inside yet the flame continued to use his body as a medium. The floods did not stop that night and
recounters of the tale elsewhere remembered it as a worldwide phenomenon. The steam clouds surrounding
Ahriman tore the very fabric and nature of space.

Yama the god of deaths realm opened inside Ahriman’s body. The cosmic flood of atman (souls of the
dead) and chaos flowed from outside the magician’s body. Unfathomable horror crawled from Ahriman’s chest
with a silent howling of dark fog. Ahriman’s body ripped to shreds and in its place the tear of the
cosmic fabric called nirvana.

In an historical event observed only from the eyes of the onlookers not yet killed in the ensuring
floods of torrential downpour and chaos of souls stemming from Ahriman’s once place, now exists a hole.
the gate of evil was thus opened on Earth. The cosmic river nirvana of atman (souls) balance caused
the very nature of life on Earth to change forever. Rishis (recluse pious men) and Magus (Magicians)
were torn apart with the ensuring chaos, the former blaming the latter of releasing evil.

The Ahriman’s soul rupture marked a new era. Rampant magic fire, 
rakshasa (supernatural malicious extradimensional monsters), funeral rites change dramatically
with new divine powers worshipped to save commonfolk from the new terrors at night, witch
hunts against magic practitioners, invading kingdoms hoping to take advantage of the weak Arianna
state in magical turmoil led to groups of surviving Magus to band together and create
a new school of Agni. Nava Agni.

The school curriculum eventually grew to encompass the study of the new world’s phenomena. Courses
such as rakshasa studies, extradimensional research, geology, and even martial arts to understand
and combat the newfound threats. During this time other parts of the world also faced their own 
threats, and witch hunts, and subsequent debauchery. The nation of Arianna was no more limited
to its own minding but now was a centre of worldly affair, where the curios, diplomats, travellers,
scholars, those who wanted to vanquish evil to bring honour to themselves and humanity travelled to
Arianna to experience the carnal evil.

The more concerning matters of those that considered themselves civilised, were the newfound 
sycophants, followers of the rakshasa who saw their entrance into this world as a sign of them
new god. Atheists, agnostics, and sceptics now genuinely believed in the supernatural. Science was
thrown aside for religious belief. Many rakshasa sycophants could be seen babbling to the beasts
in languages not recorded elsewhere. These people came to be known as mleechas and their heresy to
civilised folk was cause for their deaths by government laws.

There were yet others who made life of traversing the rakshasa infested plains, neither good
nor evil. Many individuals hunted, or pillaged remains of rakshasa to use their bodies often
made of strange material such
as multicoloured talons and hooves, or scaly magically infused hides for exotic leathers. New 
industries invented due to existence of rakshasas.

The Rakshasa themself was the topic of conversation among Earths inhabitants. Rakshasas being
otherworldly beings (at least invisible to the presence before their existence) were a varied lot.
Their numbers were tracked by state officials’ appointees, or landowners to try to determine
the threat they posed and their countermeasures if plausible. No one could accurately survey them
numbers since they did not breed as far as anyone recorded so far and were born
from an extra dimensional plane invading Earth through the hole that sprung up from Ahriman’s
hole.

The rakshasa varied in size, stature, colour, temperament, personality, strength, magic and countless
attributes. They were atypical. A specimen could be as short as a mouse or as tall as ten humans
standing on top of each other. Some could have two feet, others a slithering body, and others with wings.

Some specimens of rakshasa were short enough to be killed by an average human male would ignore
its own weak stature and
charge at humans with a rage so intense it would run into a spear and disembowel itself.
Although the rakshasa varied in appearance, and personality there were however uniform types of
them that could be categorised. In example flying rakshasa had the appearance of common gar alligators
yet with wings, and a defensive personality.

Their personalities and temperament meant that most considered malicious to humans, however
their malevolence varied. Often a giant like rakshasa that could rampage across a city and kill
thousands would be content scaring children and revel in its own trickery. though there was a
difference in attitudes the rakshasa remained widely regarded by humans as malicious due to
their detrimental nature. Rakshasa had no set gender. Some Rakshasa were hermaphrodites.

The rakshasa themselves curiously enough would often at times imitate humans. Many would follow
ideals such as honour, and integrity. Lawfully allowing a woman to cross their path unharmed, yet
following her home and eating her newborns. Some would even go a further step ahead by choosing
to sit back and watch humans exist and challenge the strongest humans to a duel of death. On being
defeated such honourable rakshasa who lost at duelling would submit to defeat and death.

The rakshasa used magic akin to the magus conjuration, however their powers ranged in varied
frequencies. The elements of water, thunder, and earth with the caveat they were unable to summon fire.
All other elements conjured by the rakshasa in various
machinations to cause violence and trickery. Some rakshasas could conjure Earth to rise while a cart
would go by causing it to spill its contents. Some rakshasas could appear out of nowhere from
thunderstorms causing the storms to further aggravate and splitting the Earth with its immense power.

Fire despite the cataclysmic effect it had on Earth remained the single element the rakshasa could
not control, feared and despised. Nirvana the sea of lifeforce was what encompassed the universe,
and the understanding of it was born from fire. Rakshasa traditionally recorded existed as part of Nirvana.
However, it was during Ahriman’s cataclysm, that the fabric between Atman (those remaining as good souls)
and rakshasa those of evil souls split. Rakshasa thus splits from fire. Fire became worshipped 
across the globe as a benevolent spirit known as Agni.

Rakashaa did share a curiosity of being unable to process the full range of visible light spectrum 
Like humans and other creatures from Earth. Nirvana the celestial plane was an inconceivable river 
Of souls. Like an sea of souls waves would rise and fall and together the malicious and  
Malevolent souls inside moved in the direction the current took it. Being a river naturally flame 
Was an antithesis. The spectrum of fire colours were invisible to the them in a traditional sense 
It caused an overload of their sensory organs akin to a fish out of water, or a human drowning in a 
Sea. 

The well of souls nirvana only ever interacts with fire when parts of it leak out into the universe 
Causing out material plane to exist as we know it. Souls become stars, planets, comets, and gasses. 
The furthest reaches of the universe are shrouded still in myth. Sadhus (sages) from Aryavarta  
Spoke of tales of complex artificial cities of many spokes of wheels interconnected turning 
Each other to power great buildings Into changing colours, and thundered to leap from site 
To sites powering devices unfathomable to turn great ships in space. Those ideas were considered 
Stupid and classless and those sadhus mainly lived as recluses teaching all they could pass by of 
The great mechanical cities and ships in our space. 

The guise of many rakshasas would earn them admires and worshippers. Shapeshifting was an ability
that some rakshasa employed to take the form of innocent maidens, and satisfy the intimate desires
of humans. Some would use their power to become the vizier to chiefs whispering false stories
to turn their masters against others.

Of these Rakasha and the ones that were too powerful to vanquish, there was no set leadership
amongst them. They were considered simpleminded beasts, unable to control their desires. There were to 
note those of esteemed quality, able to control their temperament causing them to rise to
great infamy.

Within Arianna Vritra was the rakashaa of drought, causing famine, through preventing rains
from pouring onto 
farmland. He could manipulate the weather to his liking and his vanity for his success meant 
his worshippers would be attracted throughout the world to gain entrance to such an successful 
being. His minions were known as Pani. Rakasha that could fly without wings. They spread chaos 
to humans through their ramblings of honest and false secrets, a tale of a false adultery 
scandal, a story of an honest time a man's best friend stole his belonging, causing the inherent 
evil in humans to arise stroking fear. Vritra used his Pani to spread evil throughout the world 
preventing priests from conducting rituals of piousness was his forever goal. To prevent humans 
from attaining knowledge used to defeat him.

Arianna's greenery was limited to few forests throughout the raised elevation that formed the
Aryan plateau shared with Iran on the West and slooping to Aryavarta to the East rising
further above north and downwards south. In the forests that did exist Vangrida the rakashaa
of hardships often worked in tandem and angatonism with Vritra to cause hardships, drought and
chaos to others. He would control the few forests that did exist and lure folk mad when they
departed his domain.

Urnavabha was another prominent rakasha with the power of controlling weather, thus causing draught
and causing agricultural output to fail within kingdoms and collapse of nations.

Magus, Rishi, Sadhus and foreign scholars from Misr, Shang, Mycenae and beyond would  
together would work in tandem to learn, document and react to the newfound threats 
that faced this world. Putting aside differences in opinion it was a necessary reaction to the worldly 
affairs. New weapons were forged from the hides and parts of the rakashha themselves to annihilate them. 
New spells were conjured in order to control, and destroy them. New sciences in order to reveal 
the very nature of their existence.

With the advent of evil. Evil themself came to be civilised. Rakasha themselves found order and 
piousness in the divine pantheon of mortal men and the stars. Asuras and Devas were known as the
class of celestial beings existing on other planets and dimensions that held power so vast that
human minds would come to madness trying to understand it. Some Rakasha found honour serving
Asuras and Devas that suited their personalities, others were cowards that looked for stronger
beings to protect them from being hunted by others.

Asuras and Deva's were long studied before Rakshasa arived. Great monuments were risen and fell as
time passed on earth to their pantheon. Asuras and Deva's were said to use agents of mortal men
to corrupt the other disbeliever into following them. In recent times rakshasa themselves would
conduct the covert prostelization. Thus became a schism in cosmic order on Earth. New states would
come to hate one another based on their religions divinity.

Although the schism did exist between the two forms of divinity they were both said to be the same.
Scholars on the topic could point out that merely worship of each other were akin to dialects in a 
language tree. Using cultural artefacts they would piece together lexicons to show the juxtaposition
of the two divinities were merely seperated by geographical dispersed believers who have come to 
refer to the celestial beings in their own common language.

Stories were thus told first from oral tradition passed along in campfires before literacy was widespread
then to scrolls written in strict gramatical syntax as to never forget or make mistakes on the very
nature of studied beings. Scrolls of knowledge became the lifeblood of Empires, and Arianna was a centre
of fantastical schools of knowledge in science, religion, philosophy and culture. The best school
of them all was Nava Agni. The new school of fire.

In centre of Nava agni existed the Bagh a traditional Aryan garden of agricultural crops, herbal
plants and decorative flowering plants. Freshwater from dug sources sprang fresh water introduced
with barbs and loaches.
The Bagh was populated with local wildlife from pigeons (rock doves), caracels, bovine, goats,
chickens, peacock, various fish and insects.The Bagh's main attraction was a lone orphaned Rhino
named Jagannath. Jagannath's parents were poached for food and ivory. Before his adoption into
Nava Agni his handlers carved an equsitie statue of the galaxy with surya (sun) a diety of
the realm in the centre preventing his poaching due to the unique recognisable pattern by
authorities.

Of the inhabitants. It would house just under a 100 Magus and Sadhus. It's Alumini consisted of
Philosophers from all over the known world. Rishis, Gypsies and foreign travellers would number
in hundreds living in camps selling trinkets and foreign goods from whatever they could find.
The student body was double the size of both, of mixed heritages. The rich and poor would send
their children to study. Some to become powerfull scholars when they graduate and for some
a place to offboard extra mouths to feed. The place had no use for guards as no one dared to
storm or betray an fortress of fire manipulators ready to burn alive transgressors.

What of the leadership of Nava agni? Magians who excelled at tasks of courage, justice, and 
piety who reached the highest ranks of all other magian were deemed Mobed. Mobed's held the
highest ranks amongst all magi. Nava Agni's head Mobed named Porus was a tall spcimen amongst
Aryans. The tales of his rise to lead the priesthood is riddled with tales of conjuring 
fires to drench floods, causing ice covered mountaintops to melt allowing the kingdom to
create new traderoutes. His spells could warm the Earth to sprout seedlines feeding thousands.
His charity led him to adopt orphans of all the zoorkaneh (gymanisms) whose parents were called
to wars and passed. He was surronded by those same orphans now children of Porus. They 
together formed the first circle of magi. The leading political board of magic on Earth.

Porus vice was his lost youth. His aging cracked face of dark veins across his brown face
were similar to the canyons between mountains. His colour resembled the dark yellow hued
sands of the surrounding deserts. His voice was cracked and spoke softly yet none dared
to challange him. Though not many could recall seeing the Mobed casting a spell of recent
his legacy was never challenged. Those that did would face the dire wrath of the Circle.

Together Shah Pitaji and Mobed Porus ruled the citizens of Porus and accepted refugees amongst
the land. No matter the hardships faced by the citizens they had in their hearts faith that
their rulers would protect them. At times of war, from the early beginings of the state
adults in villages centred on Zoorkaneh's would be paid stipident to train and conscript for
warfare and local authority protection. Arianna's realm was protected by more protected forces
known as immortals. Legendary warrios seeped in mythology said to date back to being childrens
of the first gods that birthed with each other on Eath producing thus offspring.

Though a picture of safe guarded kingdom with apt leadership can be portrayed preventing
the Rakashha and surrounding evils, the evil that existed within humans caused it's
greatest suffering. It was unfortunate for thus Arianna was the source of all magic practition.
Rogue Magians spread their own corrupted beliefs amongst the realm. Rogue Magians were generally
ignored posing only threat to their locality or questioning the morales of conservative folk at best.
The worst of rogue Magians instead of working towards good would make pacts with Rakashaa.
This was reserved as the worst of sins committed against the circle, as Magians were Arianna's
and the world for that matter's best defence against the vile creatures.

A rogue magian by the name of Zarah was unfortunatly a cause of dread amongst the land that
stretched from Misr to Aryavarta. Her story was the sadest spread orally for literature
about her story was forbidden to prevent uprisings in the kingdom. A daughter of a torturous
father who sexually abused Zarah as a child forced her to run away where she was captured,
held captive, abused, tortured and forced to become a prostitute. Her story as a Mage came
many decades later of rape, abuse, torture and hate. A Magian would visit her as a client
and often teach her magic. Zarah craving power she lacked latched onto the Magian and saw
in him happiness. After many unknown cycles of the earth eventually the client stopped
comming. Zarah dying to learn the truth of his dissapearance learnt he was asked by the circle
to return to be assigned a task to question a bandit some distance away. The clientelle
was attacked at swordpoint and slain.

Zarah with all the rage in her heart cried out with the hatred of the world in her cell.
Hearing the howling amongst the void an unknown Asura heard and travelled through
Nirvana reaching the wailing woman. Asura AAhsakar the divinity of the extradimensional
planet disimilar to Earth appeared amongst the wailing woman. AAhsakar was a powerfull 
manipulator of physics in his own planet who cast a spell in their own tongue and technique
looking for extradimensional demons themselves to study. Before Zarah's eyes a mist of 
AAhsakar hesitated in front of her. The two stood in awe and fear each in their primitive
thought patterns considering each other as a Rakashaa.

Zarah contemplating fleeing wished nothing more then dying herself pictured her death with
the creature in front of her. She hesitated before speaking in blunt simple sylables words.
De-vi. A-su-ra. Ra-ka-sh-aa. Ma. Pa...? finishing each word with the tonal inflection of a
sentence. AAhsakar responded mirroring the same expressions and matching the same short
sylable words to back to Zahra. Each saw each other as a mist through the haze of the boundary
of Nirvana. AAhsakar in his world had heard of stories of a world of nāraṅgī to kapila
coloured uniform creatures that had yet mastered the arts of vimāna (space voyaging ships)
yet were a favoured by powerfull divinity. Their planet was known as pṛthvī (Earth).
