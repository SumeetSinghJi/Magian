Known bugs

1. Fatal flaw in code - When selecting a new level e.g. Level 2, how does the game know to input(), logic()?
it has something to do with while (!gameover) {...}. how can I fix this professionally.

1.1. Level select option plays theme music not music for level

2. Cannot set locale, therefore cannot cin <<, then cout >> unicode e.g. Jap, Chinese, in settings()
