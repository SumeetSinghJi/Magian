Known problems

1. How does game call draw(), setup(), input(), logic() simultaniously? can this be multi-threaded?

2. Need Internationalisation (Foreign language) option. Pending Locale implementation.

3. POSIX KB input - use ncurses for DEV, then in full version use SDL 2 with OpenGL. 

4. Resources.res isn't linking to tasks.json to compile .exe with icon.
