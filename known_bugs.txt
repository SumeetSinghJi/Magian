Known problems/bugs

1. Past level 1 e.g. on Level 2, how does the game know to setup(), input(), logic()?
does it relate to while (!gameover) while lives > 0. so as long as lives > 0, the 
game will keep setup(), input(), logic() for every level is that correct?

Basically are draw/setup/input/logic functions constantly called? would it be better to use multi-threading instead?

2. Cannot set locale, therefore cannot cin <<, then cout >> unicode e.g. Jap, Chinese, in settings()

3. for void input_POSIX() - import <ncurses.h> for linux kb input

4. Resources.res isn't linking to tasks.json to compile .exe with icon
