Known problems/bugs

1. Past level 1 e.g. on Level 2, how does the game know to setup(), input(), logic()?
does it relate to while (!gameover) while lives > 0. so as long as lives > 0, the 
game will keep setup(), input(), logic() for every level is that correct?

2. Cannot set locale, therefore cannot cin <<, then cout >> unicode e.g. Jap, Chinese, in settings()

3. clear_screen(); in draw_level_1(); is too slow. used hard coded system("cls") faster for buffering

4. <conio.h> for keyboard input logic in logic() is Windows OS only, consider <ncurses.h> for linux

5. Resources.res isn't linking to tasks.json to compile .exe with icon
